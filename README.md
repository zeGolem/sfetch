</p>


You might be wondering. "Why doesn't sfetch determine OS names?"
There's no binary file included that runs for every single distro so the "OS: " just prints "Linux"

sfetch is a simple and minimal system information tool written in `C++`. it displays info about your system. some things like the time, kernel version, and the shell/desktop. 

You can get the source code by downloading the tar.xz archive or using `git clone` command.
