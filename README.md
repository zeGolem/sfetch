simplefetch (aka sfetch) is a simple and minimal system information tool written in C++.

You can get the source code by downloading the tar.xz archive or using git clone command.

### simplefetch is being renamed to sfetch. the optional tar.xz file is still simplefetch. the c++ filename is still simplefetch. and as you launch the gui installer it still says simplefetch.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/omxr4216/sfetch
```
List options.
```

```
Install sfetch

```
(Optional) Execute the GUI installer and install sfetch.

```
